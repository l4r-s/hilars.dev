          <p>Managing alerts for online mentions can be a game-changer for staying updated on relevant topics, monitoring brands, or tracking industry trends. For those who use <strong><Link href="https://f5bot.com" target="_blank">F5Bot</Link></strong>, a free service that alerts you whenever your chosen keywords are mentioned online, managing a large set of keywords can sometimes feel overwhelming. That’s where automation can help—but it’s important to do so responsibly.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl">The Problem: Managing Keywords at Scale</h2>
          <p><Link href="https://f5bot.com" target="_blank">F5Bot</Link> is an amazing tool, but adding, enabling, and configuring keywords manually can become tedious as the number of keywords grows. To solve this, I built a Python script that automates keyword management. However, automation must be designed with respect for the service it interacts with.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl">The Solution: A Responsible Automation Script</h2>
          <p>My script, <code>f5bot_keywords.py</code>, reads keywords from a YAML file and submits them to <Link href="https://f5bot.com" target="_blank">F5Bot</Link> via its web interface. It includes features like enabling/disabling alerts and matching whole words. To avoid overwhelming <Link href="https://f5bot.com" target="_blank">F5Bot</Link>’s servers, I implemented a <strong>random delay</strong> (1-7 seconds) between requests. This ensures fair use and reduces server load.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl">Why Responsible Automation Matters</h2>
          <p><Link href="https://f5bot.com" target="_blank">F5Bot</Link> is a <strong>free service</strong>, created and maintained by developers who generously provide it for everyone. Abusing such tools by overloading their servers or exceeding fair-use expectations can harm other users and increase maintenance costs for the creators.</p>
          <p>My script ensures responsible usage by implementing safeguards like the random delay. By respecting these tools, we can ensure they remain available for everyone.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl">How to Use the Script</h2>
          <p>To get started:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Download the script from my GitHub (link below).</li>
            <li><strong>Install Dependencies:</strong> Use <code>pip install -r req.txt</code> to install required Python libraries.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare a YAML File:</strong> Define your keywords and settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Run the Script:</strong> Execute the script with your <Link href="https://f5bot.com" target="_blank">F5Bot</Link> credentials and YAML file as input.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Here’s an example YAML configuration:</p>
          <EmbedGist gistId="l4r-s/17fad180bf7a5de39ddc01be64acda40" file="f5bot_keywords.yaml" />

          <h2 className="text-xl">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>Automation is a powerful tool, but it comes with responsibility. By designing tools that respect the services they interact with, we can achieve efficiency while maintaining fairness. If you’re using <Link href="https://f5bot.com">F5Bot</Link> or similar tools, always ensure your actions align with their intended use. Let’s support the creators of free tools by using them ethically.</p>
